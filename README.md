# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m Hamzat Olowu

I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for building intelligent systems, solving real-world problems, and creating reliable, maintainable code. I graduated with a B.Tech in Computer Systems Technology from CityTech (CUNY) and have worked on projects spanning backend development, data analysis, DevOps, and AI applications.

## ðŸ’» What I Work On

- ðŸ”§ **Full-Stack & Backend Engineering**  
  Iâ€™ve built systems with Spring Boot, Flask, Django, and Node.js â€” often backed by PostgreSQL or S3 â€” and designed CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Docker.

- ðŸ“Š **Data-Driven Solutions**  
  Iâ€™ve analyzed NYCâ€™s MTA delay data with Pandas, GeoPandas, and Seaborn, and worked with financial datasets to build a **Marginal Tax Rate Calculator** powered by Python and Java microservices.

- ðŸ¤– **AI & Automation Projects**  
  I built an AI-powered blog writer using Hugging Face Transformers, deployed to Hugging Face Spaces with Docker â€” blending NLP with practical web interfaces.

## ðŸ”¬ Interests

- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, GCP, S3, Docker)
- Testing & CI/CD best practices (Pytest, JUnit, GitHub Actions)
- Clean architecture and design patterns
- Intelligent automation & AI for real-world use cases
- DevOps tools (Redis, Kafka â€“ exploring next)
